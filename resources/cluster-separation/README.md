# Cluster Separation

## Overview

In GitOps, cluster separation involves hosting the GitOps control plane on a separate Kubernetes cluster from the application clusters. By isolating the GitOps tool (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux) from the clusters where applications run, you create a safeguard that prevents an attacker from gaining control over the GitOps pipeline if they compromise an application cluster.

## Why It’s Important

1. **Security Isolation:** If an application cluster is compromised, the attacker won’t have direct access to the GitOps tool, helping limit the blast radius.
2. **Enhanced Control:** Having a separate GitOps cluster allows for stricter access control and monitoring around the deployment process.
3. **Reduced Attack Surface:** Application clusters typically have broader network exposure, while the GitOps cluster can be secured more tightly, reducing vulnerability to network attacks.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up a Dedicated GitOps Cluster:** Deploy your GitOps tool on a separate Kubernetes cluster that is isolated from the production and staging application clusters.
2. **Control Access:** Configure RBAC and network policies to tightly restrict access to the GitOps cluster. Only necessary services and users should have permissions.
3. **Enforce Network Isolation:** Use network policies to prevent the application clusters from directly communicating with the GitOps cluster, allowing access only for necessary pull and deployment operations.
4. **Monitor for Anomalies:** Set up logging and monitoring specifically for the GitOps cluster to alert on any suspicious activities.

## Best Practices

- **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensure only trusted users and services can interact with the GitOps control plane.
- **Network Policies:** Implement strict network segmentation to isolate the GitOps cluster from the application clusters.
- **Separate Authentication:** Consider using distinct authentication methods or identity providers for the GitOps cluster to prevent lateral movement from application clusters.
