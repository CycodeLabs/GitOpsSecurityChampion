# SLSA Provenance Verification

## Overview

Before updating or installing new GitOps tools, users should always verify the SLSA Provenance produced by the GitOps supplier. SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is a framework that ensures the integrity and security of software artifacts. By verifying the provenance of GitOps tools, users can ensure that the tools were built securely and haven't been tampered with during the supply chain process. Tools like ArgoCD, for instance, publish signed SLSA Provenance that should be verified by the end users.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. **Tool Integrity:** Verifying SLSA Provenance ensures the GitOps tool being installed or updated is legitimate and has not been altered or compromised.
2. **Prevent Supply Chain Attacks:** Supply chain attacks can manipulate software at any point in its development lifecycle. Verifying SLSA Provenance helps to ensure that the tool's origin and build history are trustworthy.
3. **Auditable Build History:** SLSA Provenance provides an auditable record of the build process, which is crucial for understanding and validating the security of the software.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Verify the SLSA Provenance Document:**
   - Use appropriate tooling to validate the signature of the SLSA Provenance document. This ensures that the document hasn't been tampered with and is legitimate.
3. **Verify Build History:**
   - Ensure that the SLSA Provenance includes a complete, secure, and verifiable build history. Investigate any discrepancies if present.
4. **Use Trusted Sources:**
   - Only install or update GitOps tools from verified and trusted sources (e.g., official GitHub repositories, verified release channels).

## Best Practices

- **Automate Verification:** Integrate automated provenance verification into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure every installation and update of GitOps tools is validated.
- **Cross-Verify Provenance:** Cross-check provenance signatures across tools and updates to ensure the integrity of the GitOps toolset is maintained over time.
