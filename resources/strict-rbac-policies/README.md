# Strict RBAC Policies

## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies are essential for ensuring that only the necessary individuals or teams have access to manage the GitOps system and that the GitOps agent has the appropriate permissions to manage specific namespaces and clusters. In addition, enforcing policies through admission controllers helps ensure that configurations deployed via GitOps meet your organization's security and compliance standards. Implementing strict RBAC policies mitigates the risks associated with over-permissioning and unauthorized changes to the GitOps system or the resources it manages.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. **Minimizing Unauthorized Access:** Strict RBAC ensures that only authorized individuals, such as the DevOps team, have administrative access to the GitOps system, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes.
2. **Limiting Permissions of the GitOps Agent:** The GitOps agent should only have the necessary permissions to manage specific namespaces and clusters, reducing the potential damage if the agent is compromised.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Limit Access to GitOps System:**
   - Grant administrative access to the GitOps system only to specific teams, such as the DevOps team. Developers should not have access to modify or manage GitOps configurations.
2. **Restrict GitOps Agent Permissions:**
   - Configure the GitOps agent to manage only the namespaces and clusters that are explicitly allowed, ensuring the agent has minimal and appropriate permissions.
3. **Implement Admission Control:**
   - Set up admission controllers to validate that the configurations being deployed via GitOps comply with the security and policy requirements of your organization, ensuring that only compliant resources are applied to your cluster.

## Best Practices

- **Least Privilege Principle:** Limit administrative access to GitOps configurations to only authorized personnel, such as DevOps engineers, and avoid granting excessive permissions to developers.
- **Restrict Agent Access:** Ensure that the GitOps agent is configured with permissions only for the namespaces and clusters it needs to manage.
- **Policy Enforcement with Admission Control:** Use admission controllers to validate that GitOps deployments meet your organization's policies before they are applied to production environments.
- **Audit and Monitor RBAC Configurations:** Regularly audit RBAC policies to ensure that only the necessary users have access to GitOps and that access control is consistently enforced.

## Priority Level

- **Gold:** Ensuring strict RBAC policies is a critical step in securing your GitOps workflows. It is essential for protecting access and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
