# Restrict Repository Access

## Overview

In a GitOps workflow, repositories that store Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and other configuration files are critical for managing infrastructure. These repositories should be kept private, and access should be strictly limited to authorized individuals or teams. Accepting outside collaborators or granting broad access increases the risk of unauthorized changes, whether accidental or malicious.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

1. **Protect Sensitive Data:** Configuration repositories often contain sensitive infrastructure details that must be kept secure. Unauthorized access could expose sensitive information or lead to misconfigurations that compromise the security of the system.
2. **Limit Access to Authorized Teams:** Only a small number of people (e.g., from the DevOps team) should have permissions to modify or manage the repository. This ensures that those with the necessary expertise control critical resources while reducing the attack surface.
3. **Better Access Control:** By separating configuration repositories from source code repositories (as discussed in [Separating Config Vs. Source Code Repositories](resources/separating-config-vs-source-code-repos/README.md)), you ensure that access is granted based on roles and needs, further enforcing the principle of least privilege.
4. **Minimize Risk of Accidental Changes:** Limiting access helps reduce the likelihood of accidental changes by individuals who should not have the ability to modify infrastructure configurations, further protecting production environments.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Keep Repositories Private:** Ensure that your GitOps configuration repositories are set to private and restrict public access.
2. **Restrict Collaborators:** Do not accept outside collaborators. Limit access to only a small group of trusted individuals or specific teams, such as the DevOps team, who are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure.
3. **Use Branch Protection:** Apply branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized or accidental changes, requiring code reviews and approval for any changes.
4. **Monitor Access:** Regularly audit repository access and ensure that permissions are up to date, and only authorized individuals have access to the repository.

## Best Practices

- **Enforce Least Privilege Access:** Limit repository access to the smallest possible set of individuals or teams (e.g., DevOps) to ensure that only those with a legitimate need can modify configurations.
- **Use Access Control Tools:** Leverage tools provided by your version control system (e.g., GitHub or GitLab) to manage repository access, and ensure permissions align with team responsibilities.
- **Implement Branch Protection:** Use branch protection rules to enforce review and approval processes before changes are merged into key branches (e.g., main or production branches).
- **Regularly Audit Repository Access:** Periodically review and audit repository access to ensure that permissions are still appropriate and compliant with security policies.
